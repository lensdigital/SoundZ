"SoundZ"" is an audio library for playing back uncompressed WAV files from SPI Flash with Arudino.
It's based on WaveHC library by Adafruit (and William Greiman) and modified by Lensdigital to read files
from SPI Flash instead of SD card. 
It requires SerialFlash library.

This library is work in progress. Currently there are issues like Audio Artifacts and lack of functionality to pause/resume and others.
